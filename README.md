WoW Addon to search AH for specific items, filter based on if they are worth buying and reselling. Then list those items. 

very far from working. 

todo:
lazy load group imports
search group
find profitable flips based on secondOrder-firstOrder
only show profitable flips in UI
auto next item selection via buy button
buy button that doesnt look stupid
